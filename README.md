# Jenie

This is a python backend implementation of Jean.

Jean is a personal lifestyle organisation project that I'm working on in my spare time.

My plan is for this to be the backend for Jean to allow front end UIs to sit on top.

Let's see what we can create...

# How To Run
On windows, change to the directory of the app \
Step 1: ```cd H:\Code\PycharmProjects\Jenie\Jenie``` \
Step 2: ```set FLASK_APP=run.py``` \
Step 3: ```flask run```
